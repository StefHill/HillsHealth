# Scope Definition

### Introduction
#### Document Purpose
This Document has a number of key purposes:
- To explain the need for this project to be progressed – the problem or opportunity.
- To understand any specific drivers or constraints that apply to the project and to justify assumptions on why IT and manual solutions are needed.
- To record the project objectives and high-level requirements (functional and non-functional).
- To establish and baseline the scope of the project, including in-scope processes and classes of data.

This document will NOT describe a solution.  In particular, requirements should not mention specific IT applications, components or interfaces between them.  Those things however could be mentioned in accompanying information such as background information etc. where appropriate.

#### Target Audience
All business and IT stakeholders.

### Business Context
#### Project Background
There is no main-stream online resource available to present medical research to a non-academic audience.  Users are therefore reliant on the abundance of opinion and hear-say when seeking answers to their health and medical questions.  

A solution is required that will produce abstractive summarisations (AS) on a number of key health topics.  It is envisaged that the reviews will be presented via a short video or infographic through social media.  The process will need to be automated where possible with limited manual intervention or re-write.  

Following the launch of HillsHealth.org in 2012, this current project will automate what was previously a manual solution, and deliver the summaries in a contemporary and salient manner.

#### Problem/Opportunity Statement

The volume of fake and mis-leading online articles covering health and medical opinion makes it difficult for the user to differentiate fact from fiction.  Trials published in medical journals are the gold-standard of health and medical information and should be accessible to all.  However, the academic slant of these papers make them incomprehensible to the non-scholar, and with a pay-wall preventing full access to all but a few sites, a solution is required to bring the information to the layman and provide an on-line audience with a better alternative to the current volume of mis-leading, and often dangerous, medical and health information. 

This project will look to enhance the on-line experience by giving users access to evidence-based medicine and health information that is both summarised and paraphrased.  The solution will engage the user via social-media and provide the AS via short on-line videos or infographics.  Output is expected to be automated with limited manual review.  This will allow for a greater volume of articles that is currently possible via the current HillsHealth.org site.


### Business Objectives
|Ref | Title|	Description|
|---|---|---|
|BOJ01 |	Process Optimisation |	Automate the AS of medical papers from scientific journals|
|BOJ02 |	Source Scoring | Score the quality of the journal and the paper|
|BOJ03 |	Content Production | Present AS in a contemporary, clear, and eye-catching manner|
|BOJ04 |	Content Delivery| Use social media to deliver AS to the wider audience| 
|BOJ05 |	Content Optimisation| Use keywords and other SEO techniques to promote the summaries|


### Critical Success Factors
|Ref |	Title |	Description|
|---|---|---|
|CSF01 | Automation | The deliverable must be able to summarise and paraphrase medical papers.|
|CSF02 | Data accuracy | Summaries must accurately reflect the source paper.|
|CSF03 | Quality score | The quality of the source paper must be scored based on established criteria.|
|CSF04 | Content Delivery | The output must be presented via motion graphic or infographic|
|CSF05 | User engagement | The deliverable must be clear and offer customers an easy to understand solution.|
|CSF06 | Increase in user metrics | Increase in views (metric TBC)|

### Key Assumptions
- Access to medical journals is available.
- No project timescale applies.
- Resource is available for all aspects of the project.
- Funding is available for the project.

### Drivers and Constraints
Scope -  The project needs to automate the AS of medical papers and present the output via an online graphic.

Quality – All requirements must be well defined to facilitate the build quality of the design.

Time – The project must go live on (date TBD)

Cost -  Funding is available for all elements of the project


|Driver | Descriptions of importance or any constraints that are relevant | Priority
|---|---|---|
|Time |	Earliest possible delivery |3 |
|Cost |	Within funding budget | 4 |
|Quality | Summaries must be of a quality that adds value to the customer’s experience |2| 
|Scope | Provide AS of medical papers and publish online | 1 |

### Definition of Scope
#### Processes
|Processes|Description of Impact|
|---|---|
|Data Mining | Extract medical papers from scientific journals specific to a chosen topic.|
|Natural Language Processing | Transform the medical papers to a summarised and paraphrased review. Reviews should be a handful of key points covering participants, study and results.|
|Source Quality| Score the Journal (impact factor) and quality of the paper (Jadad scale) and present the score with the final output.|
|Data Presentation| Reviews should be presented via a graphic (either motion or infographic)|
|Manual Sanity Check| The editor will review the outcome for accuracy and suitable presentation|
|Summary Posted | The summarised and paraphrased graphic will be posted to a suitable social media site (TBC).|

#### Customer Segment
|Customer Segment| Description of Impact|
|---|---|
|All|The output should be universally available via social media and will cover the following key health topics; Diet & Nutrition, Sports & Exercise, Cardiovascular & Stroke, Complementary Medicine, Diabetes, Cancer & Oncology, Pregnancy & Paediatrics, Elderly and Rheumatology, Dating and Happiness.|

#### Out of Scope

Updating the 'as-is' WFE of HillsHealth.org (phase 2 : non-MVP)

Posting the output of this deliverable to HillsHealth.org (phase 2 : non-MVP)

Prescription data, population health statistics, and health spending as a reflection of evidence-based medicine (phase 2 : non-MVP).

Further analysis of the data collected, i.e. systematic reviews of collected summaries

Narrative evidence analysis via annonymous patient and doctor experinces or case studies.
