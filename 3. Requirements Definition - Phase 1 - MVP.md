# Requirements Definition - Phase 1 - MVP

### Introduction
#### Document Purpose
The key purpose of the Requirements Definition is to record the mid-level and detailed requirements for the project and express these from the perspective of an end-user goal. i.e. a User Story.  

#### Target Audience
All business and IT stakeholders.

### Business Context, Scope and High-Level Requirements
The following items are recorded and baselined in the Scope Definition document and not duplicated here:

- Project Background
- Problem/Opportunity Statement
- Business Objectives
- Critical Success Factors
- Drivers and Constraints
- Definition of Scope
- High Level Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)

### Business Process Model
The Business Process Model covers the proposed processes to ensure a common understanding among all stakeholders and covers the whole project scope, including those aspects that are not expected to have an IT solution.  This enables any additional area that might require an IT solution to be identified.

The main section includes a number of requirements artefacts that span across the in-scope processes:

Business Event – This change will be driven by the development of an algorithm to summarise and paraphrase medical trials (as published within medical journals), and present the output as a snapshot utilising social media.  This will provide a validated and authoritative stance on health and medical issues, which will be presented in a straight-forward and engaging manner. 


### Actors

|Actor |	Description|
|---|---|
|Users |	New or existing users who wish to view contemporary, succinct, and evidence-based health information. |

### Process
#### Current Process
HillsHealth.org was the original development completed in 2012.  The manual process of creating the summarised reviews was labour intensive, and the lack of any SEO or social media presence has meant that traffic has remained low.
