### Business Overview

With recent advances in deep learning techniques, there has been notable progress in extractive text summarisation whereby important sentences or phrases are identified and extracted from the original text. 

However, here we will work towards an abstractive summariser whereby the sentences generated may not appear in the original text.  The work will focus on the abstractive summarisation of academic publications (medical journals).

The below diagram illustrates the difference between extractive and abstractive summarisation:
