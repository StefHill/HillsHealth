1.0	Introduction
1.1	Document Purpose
The key purpose of the Requirements Definition is to record the mid-level and detailed requirements for the project and express these from the perspective of an end-user goal. i.e. a User Story.  

1.2	Target Audience
All business and IT stakeholders.
2.0	Business Context, Scope and High Level Requirements
The following items are recorded and baselined in the Scope Definition document and not duplicated here:

•	Project Background
•	Problem/Opportunity Statement
•	Business Objectives
•	Critical Success Factors
•	Drivers and Constraints
•	Definition of Scope
•	High Level Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)
3.0 Business Process Model
The Business Process Model covers the proposed processes to ensure a common understanding among all stakeholders and covers the whole project scope, including those aspects that are not expected to have an IT solution.  This enables any additional area that might require an IT solution to be identified.

The main section includes a number of requirements artefacts that span across the in-scope processes:

Business Event – This change will be driven by the introduction of Collective Investments (CI) to the existing investment opportunities available through the NRP.  A secure web portal will enable customers to self-service and manage their CI’s online.  This will result in an improved user experience, robust NRP functionality, and remain in line with our competitor sites.
