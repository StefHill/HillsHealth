# Requirements Definition

### Introduction
#### Document Purpose
The key purpose of the Requirements Definition is to record the mid-level and detailed requirements for the project and express these from the perspective of an end-user goal. i.e. a User Story.  

#### Target Audience
All business and IT stakeholders.

### Business Context, Scope and High-Level Requirements
The following items are recorded and baselined in the Scope Definition document and not duplicated here:

- Project Background
- Problem/Opportunity Statement
- Business Objectives
- Critical Success Factors
- Drivers and Constraints
- Definition of Scope
- High Level Requirements (Functional and Non-Functional)

### Business Process Model
The Business Process Model covers the proposed processes to ensure a common understanding among all stakeholders and covers the whole project scope, including those aspects that are not expected to have an IT solution.  This enables any additional area that might require an IT solution to be identified.

The main section includes a number of requirements artefacts that span across the in-scope processes:

Business Event – This change will be driven by the development of an algorithm to summarise and paraphrase medical trials (as published within medical journals), and present the output as a snapshot utilising social media.  This will provide a validated and authoritative stance on health and medical issues, which will be presented in a straight-forward and engaging manner. 


### Actors

|Actor |	Description|
|---|---|
|Users |	New or existing users who wish to view contemporary, succinct, and evidence-based health information. |

### Process
#### Current Process
HillsHealth.org was the original development completed in 2012.  The manual process of creating the summarised reviews was labour intensive, and the lack of any SEO or social media presence has meant that traffic has remained low.  

#### Proposed Process (draft)

![Process Overview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/85082902-22953200-b1c8-11ea-8064-19a9aff0e8e7.png)

|Step |
|---|
|1. State the question to be answered |
|2. Search for trials based on the question / keywords |
|3. Apply the exclusion criteria (>2000, Humans, English, full text (study types as below, and clinical study, comparative study, controlled clinical trial, journal article, observational study) |
|4. Tabulate characteristics of the highest ranking 250 trials identified in order of study quality (title, DOI, keywords) |
|5. Search and iterate over 250 trials based on DOI |
|6. Tabulate an outcome (‘yes’ or ‘no’) for each of the bullet points on the recognition of key words from the paper quality score.  Return a 5gram based on the words around the found keyword |
|7. Rank the papers based on the scoring system (journal quality, study quality, paper quality, number of participants |
|8. Review and exclusion criteria to output |
|9. Review output and prepare a summary of the key findings |
|10. Create simple motion graphic of key findings |

##### Score based on
1. Journal quality based on its impact factor

2. Study quality based on the following.
* Systematic review of randomly controlled trials / RCT
* Randomly controlled trials / RCT
* Systematic reviews of cohort studies
* Cohort studies / longitudinal
* Consensus statements
* Systematic review of case control studies
* Case-control studies
* Expert opinion / cross-sectional survey / case report / case series

3. Paper quality score based on the following.
* Was the study described as randomised?
* Was the study described as double blind?
* Is there a description / number of those who withdrew / dropped out?
* Was there a conflict of interest?
* Was the study listed on a trial register/clinical trials?

Return the following (1 line per study)

4. Notes from abstract. Why was the study performed (what clinical question did it address)?

5. Number of participants / patients
6. How were the participants recruited?
7. Who was excluded from the study?
8. What age, sex and disease severity, where did they come from/live? 
10. Was the study described as blind?

11. What treatment or other intervention was offered or was it only compared to a placebo.
12. What outcome measure(s) were used.

13. Was follow-up complete enough (or response rate if survey)

14. Limitations clearly described.
15. Were the groups comparable in all important aspects except for the variable being studied?
16. Type or frequency of adverse reactions?
17. Notes from summary
