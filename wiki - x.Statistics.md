## Analysing Data

#### Exploring and interpreting data
1.        Dataset terminology; 
          - Observations (or cases, or sampling units) refer to objects (people, countries, . . . ) on which characteristics are recorded. 
          - Variables are the characteristics recorded, and the pattern of variation of a variable is its distribution. 
          - Variables are linked if they are each recorded for the same observations. 
          - A variable is continuous if its values are numerical and all values in an interval are possible. 
          - A variable is discrete if its values are numerical but only particular values (typically, integers) are possible. 
          - A variable is categorical if its values indicate to which group an observation belongs. 
          - A categorical variable is ordinal if its values correspond to labels which have a natural ordering (agree, mildly agree, mildly disagree, disagree). 
          - A categorical variable is nominal if its values correspond to labels but the labels do not have a natural ordering (woodland, swamp, desert).
