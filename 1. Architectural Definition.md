# Architectural Definition

## Introduction
This page will provide a continuous overview of the current project.  It is not intended to replicate or negate the need for a full architectural cycle, but should be seen as an ‘architecture-light’ process that allows the reader to see an up-to-date and clear overview of the deliverable.

The following pages will explore the scope and requirements in ever-increasing detail, and as such, will become siloed within there relevant sections.  This page will provide a clear overview of the bigger picture whilst leaning on the  TOGAF/Architectural principles. 

### Project Statement
HillsHealth.org is an online site built in 2012 which contains a number of summarised health and medical trials covering 9 key topics.  The as-is process needs to be extended to allow for an automated meta-analysis and abstractive summariser.

### Business Context
HillsHealth.org currently provides ~500 summarised and paraphrased medical trials covering a range of key health subjects.  The objective is for these past-learnings to be the foundation of an extended eco-system that covers published health and medical journals, and how these peer-reviewed trials support or oppose current GP prescription data, current health spending, wider population health statistics, and specific health concerns.  These new deliverables will be provided through social media and through enhancements to the current HillsHealth.org domain.

The assumptions of the eco-system are that the following are included:
* It is assumed that access to evidence-based medicine/health is available.
* It is assumed that access to GP presciption data and population health statistics is available.
* It is assumed that, where possible, the end-to-end process is automated.
* The delivered content is freely available.
* It is assumed that integration within the eco-system is scalable and seamless.

### Problem Definition
Peer-reviewed health and medical research needs to be available to a non-academic audience and presented in a succinct and contemporary manner.  Furthermore, prescription, health spending, and general population health statistics should to be held up scrutiny with an emphasis on the latest and best available research.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/82125670-5b905000-979f-11ea-80f1-6ce00096a2ac.png" width="300" height="300"></p>

## Design Principles and Approach
The Architecture Development Method (shown below) is a detailed step-by-step process for implementing change and development. The ADM helps to develop processes that involve multiple check points and firmly establishes requirements.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/117441542-710d0580-af2d-11eb-9082-a681ffa765bd.png" width="300" height="300"></p>

### 1. Preliminary
#### Objectives
The current hillshealth.org solution is limited to manually generated abstractive summaries. This is a 1-to-1 approach where one article represents a single medical trial. An enhanced solution is required that will complete a meta-analysis of the primary medical trials on a given subject and produce a system generated abstractive summary.  This summary will be presented in a short video format.

As a private project there will be no external stakeholders involved.  Software resources are required as are licences to a number of software suites including Adobe CC and Azure.  The SDLC principles will be followed within a high level TOGAF/BCS structure.

The key driver for this piece is to enable users to source a gold-standard of health information in a way that is engaging and easily understood.  There is no particular framework to be followed and no sponsor.  Furthermore, as a private project, there are no human resource needs, no commercials, cultural aspirations or strategic intent, no change management process, definition of done or specified framework (i.e. Agile / Lean).

#### Capability and Approach
This deliverable must establish a solution that is capable of generating abstractive summaries of a meta-analysis of medical trials on a given topic/question.  The solution will search using publicly available medical databases, and collect trials from open-access and subscribed providers.  Abstractive summaries, rather than extractive summaries, will be generated from the trials/papers that meet certain standards and relevance.  The output will be converted from text to video.


### 2. Architecture Vision (Business Outcome)
#### 1. Literature Search and meta-analysis
A specific health question or topic will be searched via a health database.  The results returned will be filtered to include only those that meet a set criteria and therefore a certain level of quality.  The chosen papers will form the basis of a meta-analysis/systematic analysis that will prodcuce an overall outcome or opinion. 
#### 2. Abstractive Summarisation
The output of the meta-analysis/systematic review will be analysed and an abstractive summary produced.  This will be a system generated abstract and will cover; a) participants, b) study, c) results, d) conclusion.
#### 3. Video output
The results of the abstractive summary will be the basis for a short video which will be posted to social media.

Who confirmed the vision and when.
How does the vision meet the goals, objectives, and stakeholder concerns/problems
Does the SoW cover this vision, and if so, does it cover the same idea.
Include a process map/business model here to how this will deliver the goals/strategy to stakeholders and customers.

#### Vision
The vision for the deliverable is to:

* MVP: Publish abstractive summaries of EBM to a non-academic audience via contemporary methods.

* Non-MVP: Use published medical research and scientific study to consider the validity of ‘in-the-field’ health statistics.

![Functional view (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/82125071-3863a180-979b-11ea-8f3f-a9e571aceab5.png)

#### Functional View

The deliverable is primarily a user interactive component relying on EBM and publicly available health statistics.  It will be an integral component to summarise the EBM, present this data, and to further use the results to question population health statistics.

![Functional view](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/82389689-b9899580-9a34-11ea-992b-dab760547106.png)

#### Scope

The solution intends to deliver the following goals and principles for the platform

G1: Create a meta-analysis/systematic review of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) for key health topics.

G2: Create abstractive summaries of meta-analyses/systematic reviews.

G3: Compare the latest EBM findings with current U.K GP prescription data.

G4: Compare the latest EBM findings with current U.K. health spending.

G5: Compare the latest EBM findings with current U.K. health population statistics.

G6: Display the output via social-media and the HillsHealth.org web Front End (WFE).

G7: Consider 'narrative' evidence through case studies (personal data) from doctors and patients.

P1: Ensure the medical summaries are a fair representation of the source

P2: Ensure the output is unbiased, and where possible, contains minimal editorial re-write.

P3: Strive for automation of the summary, paraphrasing, and graphical output.

P4: Always refernce the source paper.


#### Dependencies

Access to medical papers and official health statistics

#### Goals

Goals are defined in two perspectives; firstly, the immediate goals of this work; secondly, the goal that is enabled on a successful outcome of this work.

##### Goals for this Work

In this work, we will build abstractive summaries of EBM (that is, a process that will simplify and paraphrase evidence-based medicine and health) that is automated and will target key health topics. It will generate a succinct summary of the paper and create a visualisation that will be posted to social media and the current WFE.

The development journey will also look to encompass the latest data science and analysis principles in using the journal data to evaluate the strength of prescription data, health spending, and larger population health statistics.

Finally, despite not forming part of the MVP, narrative information should be sought through doctors and patients which allow us to analyse the richness of their accumulated experiences.

##### Goals beyond this Work

A successful outcome of this work will enable expansion into further areas of health and medical research, and present complex medical information in a simplified yet targeted manner. The goal is to provide the 'gold standard' of health and medical information, namely peer-reviewed medical trials, to a non-academic and online audience.

#### Out of Scope

N/A.

The scope model below shows which system features are in-scope (inside the boundary) and which ones are out of scope (outside the boundary).  We do not intend to analyse individual trial data (where available), or merge similar trials to form a meta-consensus view.  However, summaries may include editorial notes in order to discount papers that have gained traction by making striking conclusions.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/87785938-fdc8c480-c830-11ea-9d59-5b3cfbfacb03.png"></p>

#### Critical Success Factors

* CSF01: Automation -The deliverable must be able to summarise and paraphrase medical papers.

* CSF02: Data accuracy - Abstractive summaries must accurately reflect the source paper.

* CSF03: Content Delivery - The output must be presented via motion graphic or infographic

* CSF04: User engagement - The deliverable must be clear and offer customers an easy to understand solution.

* CSF05: Increase in user metrics - Increase in views (metric TBC)

#### Conceptual Data Model

Below is the draft conceptual data model for the deliverable.  This model is intended to show core entities and their relationships and dependencies.  The model also shows relationships to other data sets within the eco-system e.g prescription and population data.  This will take a more detailed shape and will be input for the logical data model as more requirements and to-be business processes are documented.

#### Application View

##### Packages and Components

--The following component diagram is a place holder and needs updating
![Component Diagram (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45914355/87832274-8bca9c80-c87d-11ea-95e4-3526092db0ed.png)

##### Interfaces

_Upstream solutions provide data to this solution, downstream solutions receive data from this solution.  Solutions may be both upstream and downstream.  Interfaces should be categorised as interactive or bulk and the transfer mechanisms described._

###### Upstream Dependencies

Pubmed.gov will be the primary search tool for journal citation.  An API will search and retrieve the links to the full text articles.  There is no intention to use abstract only papers which would not allow the strength of the paper to be measured, or allow for an accurate summarisation of the data.

If available, direct access to journal sites may be required where a) costs permit, and b) it is felt that the topics covered are current and in the immediate public interest.

Open access data sources will provide input to the deliverable and allow analysis against trial findings.  In all instances, upstream data sources will be referenced and hyperlinked. 

###### Downstream Dependencies

No project is dependent upon completion of this deliverable. However, social media and an individual online presence will receive data from this solution.  The online presence will utilise either the hillsHealth.org or hillsHealth.co domain, and this WFE will be a point of access to the solution that is both searchable and customisable.
