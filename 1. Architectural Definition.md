# Architectural Definition

## Introduction

HillsHealth.org provides approximately 500 summarised and paraphrased medical trials covering a range of key health subjects.  The objective is for these past-learnings to be the foundation of an extended eco-system that covers published health and medical journals, and how these peer-reviewed trials support or oppose current GP prescription data, current health spending, wider population health statistics, and specific health concerns.  These new deliverables will be provided through social media and through enhancements to the current HillsHealth.org domain.

The assumptions of the eco-system are that the following are included:
* It is assumed that access to evidence-based medicine/health is available.
* It is assumed that most of the end-to-end process is automated.
* The delivered content is freely available.
* It is assumed that integration within the eco-system is scalable and seamless.
 

## Scope

The solution intends to deliver the following goals and principles for the platform

G1: Create summarised and paraphrased medical papers on key health topics.

G2: Compare the latest trial findings with current U.K GP prescription data.

G3: Compare the latest trial findings with current U.K. health spending.

G4: Compare the latest trial findings with current U.K. health population statistics.

G5: Display the output via social-media and the HillsHealth.org Digital Front End (DFE).

P1: Ensure the medical summaries are a fair representation of the source

P2: Ensure the output is unbiased, and where possible, contains minimal editorial re-write.

P3: Strive for automation of the summary, paraphrasing, and graphical output.

## Goals

Goals are defined in two perspectives; firstly, the immediate goals of this work; secondly, the goal that is enabled on a successful outcome of this work.

### Goals for this Work

In this work, we will build a medical trial snapshot (that is, a process that will simplify and paraphrase medical trials) that is automated and will target key health topics.  It will generate a succinct summary of the medical paper and create a visualisation that will be posted to social media.

### Goals beyond this Work

A successful outcome of this work will enable expansion into further areas of health and medical research, and present complex medical information in a simplified yet targeted manner.  The goal is to provide the 'gold standard' of health and medical information, namely peer-reviewed medical trials, to a non-academic and online audience.

## Business Context

The project will deliver the following capabilities
1. A medical paper summariser
2. A medical paper paraphraser
3. Automated visualisation in support of the output from 1 and 2.

### Problem Definition

Peer-reviewed health and medical research needs to be available to a non-academic audience and presented in a succinct and contemporary manner.
