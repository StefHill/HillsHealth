# Architectural Definition

## Introduction

The design intention for the solution is to build and deliver a product that will provide summarised and simplified medical information. The solution architecture defines the entirety of the environment that is exclusively for the support of the developed product.  

## Scope

The solution intends to deliver the following goals and principles for the platform

G1: Create summarised and paraphrased medical papers on key health topics.

G2: Display the output via social-media sites in a short video or graphic.

P1: Ensure the brief is a fair representation of the source

P2: Ensure the output is unbiased, and where possible, contains minimal editorial re-write.

P3: Strive for automation of the summary, paraphrasing, and ghraphical output.

## Dependencies

Access to medical papers

## Goals

Goals are defined in two perspectives; firstly, the immediate goals of this work; secondly, the goal that is enabled on a successful outcome of this work.

### Goals for this Work

In this work, we will build a medical trial snapshot (that is, a process that will simplify and paraphrase medical trials) that is automated and will target key health topics.  It will generate a succinct summary of the medical paper and create a visualisation that will be posted to social media.

### Goals beyond this Work

A successful outcome of this work will enable expansion into further areas of health and medical research, and present complex medical information in a simplified yet targeted manner.  The goal is to provide the 'gold standard' of health and medical information, namely peer-reviewed medical trials, to a non-academic and online audience.

## Business Context

The project will deliver the following capabilities
1. A medical paper summariser
2. A medical paper paraphraser
3. Automated visualisation in support of the output from 1 and 2.

### Problem Definition

Peer-reviewed health and medical research needs to be available to a non-academic audience and presented in a succinct and contemporary manner.
