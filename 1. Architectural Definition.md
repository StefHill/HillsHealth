# Architectural Definition

## Introduction

HillsHealth.org provides approximately 500 summarised and paraphrased medical trials covering a range of key health subjects.  The objective is for these past-learnings to be the foundation of an extended eco-system that covers published health and medical journals, and how these peer-reviewed trials support or oppose current GP prescription data, current health spending, wider population health statistics, and specific health concerns.  These new deliverables will be provided through social media and through enhancements to the current HillsHealth.org domain.

The assumptions of the eco-system are that the following are included:
* It is assumed that access to evidence-based medicine/health is available.
* It is assumed that most of the end-to-end process is automated.
* The delivered content is freely available.
* It is assumed that integration within the eco-system is scalable and seamless.
 

## Scope

The solution intends to deliver the following goals and principles for the platform

G1: Create summarised and paraphrased medical papers on key health topics.

G2: Compare the latest trial findings with current U.K GP prescription data.

G3: Compare the latest trial findings with current U.K. health spending.

G4: Compare the latest trial findings with current U.K. health population statistics.

G5: Display the output via social-media and the HillsHealth.org Digital Front End (DFE).

P1: Ensure the medical summaries are a fair representation of the source

P2: Ensure the output is unbiased, and where possible, contains minimal editorial re-write.

P3: Strive for automation of the summary, paraphrasing, and graphical output.

## Dependencies

Access to medical papers and official health statistics

## Goals

Goals are defined in two perspectives; firstly, the immediate goals of this work; secondly, the goal that is enabled on a successful outcome of this work.

### Goals for this Work

In this work, we will build trial summaries (that is, a process that will simplify and paraphrase evidence-based health and medicine) that is automated and will target key health topics. It will generate a succinct summary of the paper and create a visualisation that will be posted to social media and the current DFE.

The development journey will also look to encompass the latest data science and analysis principles in using the journal data to evaluate the strength of prescription data, health spending, and larger population health statistics.

### Goals beyond this Work

A successful outcome of this work will enable expansion into further areas of health and medical research, and present complex medical information in a simplified yet targeted manner. The goal is to provide the 'gold standard' of health and medical information, namely peer-reviewed medical trials, to a non-academic and online audience.

## Business Context

HillsHealth.org is an online site built in 2012 which contains a number of summarised health and medical trials covering 9 key topics.  The as-is process needs to be extended to allow for improved content delivery, social media exposure, trend analysis, and ultimately, an automated and reliable text summariser and paraphraser.

### Problem Definition

Peer-reviewed health and medical research needs to be available to a non-academic audience and presented in a succinct and contemporary manner.  Furthermore, prescription, health spending, and general population health statistics should to be held up scrutiny with an emphasis on the latest and best available research.

## Business Process Scope
### Out of Scope

Monetisation of the final deliverable is not in scope for this project.  There is no intention to add advertising to the product or seek a financial return.  The project is a personal endeavour that will build on the foundations of a CS and Statistics degree with an emphasis on data.

Phase 2 will consider a meta-analysis of the medical papers reviewed, and look to call out a consensus position in order to discount papers that have gained traction by making striking conclusions.

## Critical Success Factors

* CSF01: Automation -The deliverable must be able to summarise and paraphrase medical papers.

* CSF02: Data accuracy - Summaries must accurately reflect the source paper.

* CSF03: Content Delivery - The output must be presented via motion graphic or infographic

* CSF04: User engagement - The deliverable must be clear and offer customers an easy to understand solution.

* CSF05: Increase in user metrics - Increase in views (metric TBC)

## Design Principles and Approach
### Architecture

The vision for the deliverable is to:

* MVP: Publish simplified medical research and scientific study to a non-academic audience via contemporary methods.

* Non-MVP: Use published medical research and scientific study to consider the validity of ‘in-the-field’ health statistics.

### Functional View

The deliverable is primarily a user interactive component relying on evidence-based medicine and publicly available health statistics.  It will be an integral component to summarise the evidence-based medicine, present this data, and to further use the results to question population statistics about health.

### Use Case Model
#### Primary Actors

This section lists the primary actors for the functionality provided by the deliverable.  While defining the core actors it also lists some of the known use cases each actor will undertake.  Detailed use cases will be defined and listed separately.

_actors’ diagram to be added here_

### System Use Cases

System use cases will document how the summarised medical trials interact with other components in the eco-system.

System use cases are generally documented using a single use case diagram with different component boundaries defined.  At this level, details with the use case will not be defined or examined.

The system use case diagram below documents the know use case for the deliverable, the interaction across the eco-system, and use case journey through the system components.

## Application View
### Packages and Components
#### Interfaces

_Upstream solutions provide data to this solution, downstream solutions receive data from this solution.  Solutions may be both upstream and downstream.  Interfaces should be categorised as interactive or bulk and the transfer mechanisms described._

##### Upstream Dependencies

Pubmed.gov will be the primary search tool for journal citation.  This database will search and retrieve the links to the full text articles.  There is no intention to use abstract only papers which would not allow the strength of the paper to be measured, or allow for an accurate summarisation of the data.

If available, direct access to journal sites may be required where a) costs permit, and b) it is felt that the topics covered are current and in the immediate public interest (i.e COVID-19 during 2020).

Open access data sources will provide input to the deliverable and allow analysis against trial findings.  In all instances, upstream data sources will be referenced and hyperlinked. 

##### Downstream Dependencies

No project is dependent upon completion of this deliverable. However, social media and an individual online presence will receive data from this solution.  The online presence will utilise either the hillsHealth.org or hillsHealth.co domain, and this WFE will be a point of access to the solution that is both searchable and customisable.

## Deployment Approach
### Approach

The deployment approach for the solution will consider the following approach to delivery:

* SaaS PaaS IaaS On-Prem

*Statistical tools – Data wrangling and visualisation

*Storage – Azure

*Development – Python and relevant libraries (pandas, SkLearn)

### People and Skill Dependencies
### Environments

## Information View
### Conceptual Data Model

Below is the draft conceptual data model for the deliverable.  This model is intended to show core entities and their relationships and dependencies.  The model also shows relationships to other data sets within the eco-system e.g prescription and population data.  This will take a more detailed shape and will be input for the logical data model as more requirements and to-be business processes are documented.

### Data Quality and Timeliness
### Volumes

The numbers of summarised trials produced, and subsequent visualisations, has not been determined at this time.  Capacity is dependant upon the strength of the model produced, and any subsequent editorial clean-up.

### Transactional Management and Recovery

### Ownership and Governance

Unlike standard architecture practice, ensuring the complete follow through of the data will remain the responsibility of the owner.
